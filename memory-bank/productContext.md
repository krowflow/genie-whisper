# Product Context: Genie Whisper

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Developers spend a significant amount of time typing prompts, commands, and queries when interacting with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Roo Code, and Cline Dev. This typing process:
- Interrupts the flow of thought
- Slows down the development process
- Creates a disconnect between thinking and communicating with AI tools
- Can lead to physical strain during extended coding sessions

### Market Gap
While voice-to-text solutions exist, they typically:
- Aren't optimized for development environments
- Don't integrate directly with coding IDEs
- Lack the specialized filtering needed in development settings
- Don't offer the low-latency required for productive coding sessions
- Require constant internet connectivity

## Problems Genie Whisper Solves

1. **Efficiency Bottleneck**: Eliminates the typing bottleneck when communicating with AI coding assistants
2. **Context Switching**: Reduces the mental context switch between thinking and typing
3. **Accessibility**: Makes AI coding tools more accessible to developers with typing limitations
4. **Privacy Concerns**: Provides offline transcription for sensitive development environments
5. **Environmental Noise**: Filters out background noise and conversations in shared workspaces
6. **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly fits into existing development workflows without disruption
7. **Cognitive Load**: Allows developers to verbalize complex ideas without translating to typed text

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Installation & Setup**:
   - User installs Genie Whisper application
   - Basic configuration for microphone and preferred activation method
   - Optional IDE extension installation

2. **Daily Usage**:
   - Genie Whisper runs in system tray, minimal resource usage
   - User activates via hotkey, wake word, or toggle
   - Voice input is captured and filtered in real-time
   - Transcription appears in overlay with visual feedback
   - Text is injected directly into active IDE or chat interface
   - System automatically stops on silence or manual deactivation

3. **Configuration & Customization**:
   - User can adjust sensitivity, model size, and activation preferences
   - Customizable hotkeys and wake words
   - Theme options for visual integration with different IDEs
   - Performance settings to balance accuracy vs. speed

### Core Workflow
```
Activation → Voice Capture → Noise Filtering → Transcription → Text Preview → IDE Injection
```

### Key Interactions
- **Push-to-Talk**: Hold hotkey while speaking, release to finalize
- **Wake Word**: Say "Hey Genie" to start listening, automatic stop on silence
- **Toggle Mode**: Activate for continuous transcription until manually stopped
- **Preview Window**: See transcription before it's sent to IDE
- **Visual Feedback**: Waveform and Genie animation indicate active listening

## User Experience Goals

### Primary UX Objectives
1. **Invisible When Inactive**: Minimal presence when not in use
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Clear visual indicators when active
3. **Accuracy Confidence**: Show users what will be transcribed before finalizing
4. **Non-Disruptive**: Integrate with development workflow without interruption
5. **Customizable**: Adapt to individual preferences and environments
6. **Responsive**: Near-instant reaction to voice input
7. **Intelligent**: Smart enough to ignore background noise and conversations
