## New Direction: Jarvis-Like Assistant

We are pivoting the project to become a full Jarvis-like voice assistant with:

1. **Voice-to-Text and Text-to-Speech**: Both listen and talk back
2. **AI Agent Integration**: Speak directly to AI agents in IDEs
3. **Desktop PC as Hub**: Central system with cross-application awareness
4. **Completely Local and Free**: No cloud dependencies for core functionality
5. **Using Current Proven Technologies**: Focusing on what works today

## Technology Stack Decision

After researching available technologies, we've decided to focus on currently available, proven technologies:

1. **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper (local implementation)
2. **Text-to-Speech**: 
   - Primary option: Mozilla TTS (free, local, good documentation)
   - Alternative option: Spark-TTS (higher quality, voice cloning, but more resource-intensive)
3. **Voice Activity Detection**: Hybrid approach with WebRTC VAD and Silero VAD
4. **Wake Word Detection**: Picovoice Porcupine (free tier)
5. **System Integration**: Electron with Node.js
6. **Local Knowledge**: SQLite with FTS5
7. **AI Integration**: Direct API integration with Roo Code and other assistants
