## Known Issues

As the project is in the early implementation phase, there are some known issues:

1. **UI Responsiveness**: The UI layout needs improvement for different window sizes
2. **Component Integration**: React components need proper state management
3. **Build Process**: Need to set up proper TypeScript compilation and bundling
4. **Electron-React Integration**: Need to improve IPC communication between processes
5. **Styling Consistency**: Need to ensure consistent styling across components
