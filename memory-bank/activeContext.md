# Active Context: Genie Whisper

## Current Work Focus

We are pivoting the Genie Whisper project to become a **full Jarvis-like voice assistant** that works globally across all applications on the PC. The primary focus is on:

1. **Getting Basic Genie Whisper Working**
   - Fixing the core audio pipeline
   - Resolving Silero VAD model download issues (using WebRTC VAD as fallback)
   - Implementing working audio capture from microphone
   - Connecting to Whisper for transcription
   - Creating a minimal viable product with system tray and global hotkey
   - Adding text-to-speech capabilities for two-way voice interaction

2. **Expanding to Jarvis-Like Functionality**
   - Implementing command recognition system
   - Adding global system integration
   - Creating enhanced IDE integration for AI agent communication
   - Implementing local knowledge base
   - Building automation features

3. **Ensuring Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Implementing platform-specific integrations
   - Ensuring consistent experience across environments
   - Optimizing for different hardware configurations

4. **Optimizing Performance and Usability**
   - Minimizing latency in the transcription pipeline
   - Reducing resource usage
   - Improving accuracy of speech recognition
   - Enhancing user interface and experience

## Technology Stack Decision

After researching available technologies, we've decided to focus on currently available, proven technologies rather than speculating about future developments. Our core stack includes:

1. **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper (local implementation)
2. **Text-to-Speech**: 
   - Primary option: Mozilla TTS (free, local, good documentation)
   - Alternative option: Spark-TTS (higher quality, voice cloning, but more resource-intensive)
3. **Voice Activity Detection**: Hybrid approach with WebRTC VAD and Silero VAD
4. **Wake Word Detection**: Picovoice Porcupine (free tier)
5. **System Integration**: Electron with Node.js
6. **Local Knowledge**: SQLite with FTS5
7. **AI Integration**: Direct API integration with Roo Code and other assistants

This stack provides a solid foundation for a completely local, free, and powerful voice assistant.
