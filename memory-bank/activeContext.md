# Active Context: Genie Whisper

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the **UI design and implementation phase** for Genie Whisper. The primary focus is on:

1. **Implementing the core UI design**
   - Creating a clean, minimalist interface with dark purple background
   - Implementing the layout with Genie avatar on left, waveform in center, microphone on right
   - Designing futuristic cyan/pink waveform visualization
   - Ensuring the UI matches the design specifications from the provided mockups

2. **Setting up the application architecture**
   - Establishing the Electron + React frontend
   - Preparing for Python backend integration
   - Creating component structure for maintainability
   - Implementing responsive and accessible UI elements

3. **Preparing for audio integration**
   - Setting up the UI for real-time waveform visualization
   - Creating visual feedback for listening state
   - Designing the transcription preview area
   - Implementing settings panel for audio configuration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration

1. **UI Framework Approach**
   - **Current Decision**: Using React with TypeScript for component-based UI
   - **Considerations**: Performance, maintainability, developer experience
   - **Status**: Implemented initial components, evaluating performance

2. **Waveform Visualization Technique**
   - **Current Decision**: Custom CSS/JS implementation with animated bars
   - **Considerations**: Performance, visual appeal, accuracy
   - **Status**: Basic implementation complete, may enhance with WebAudio API

3. **Electron-Python Communication**
   - **Current Decision**: Using Python-Shell for IPC
   - **Considerations**: Performance, reliability, ease of development
   - **Status**: Architecture defined, implementation pending

4. **Whisper Model Selection**
   - **Current Decision**: Start with base model, allow user selection
   - **Considerations**: Performance vs. accuracy, disk space, memory usage
   - **Status**: Planning implementation

### Open Questions

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - How to minimize CPU/GPU usage during idle periods?
   - What's the optimal buffer size for audio processing?
   - How to balance transcription accuracy vs. speed?

2. **UI/UX Refinement**
   - Should we add more animation to the Genie avatar?
   - How to make the waveform visualization more accurate to actual audio?
   - Should we add keyboard shortcuts for all actions?

3. **IDE Integration**
   - What's the best approach for text injection across different IDEs?
   - How to handle different text field types?
   - How to maintain compatibility with IDE updates?

### Current Challenges

1. **UI Consistency**
   - Ensuring consistent appearance across platforms
   - Maintaining visual hierarchy with minimal UI
   - Balancing functionality with clean design

2. **Audio Visualization**
   - Creating accurate yet performant waveform visualization
   - Providing meaningful visual feedback during transcription
   - Handling different audio input scenarios

3. **Electron-Python Bridge**
   - Ensuring reliable communication between processes
   - Handling startup and shutdown gracefully
   - Managing resource usage across processes
