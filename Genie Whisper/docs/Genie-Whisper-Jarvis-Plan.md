# Genie Whisper: Full Jarvis-Like Assistant Plan

## Vision

Transform Genie Whisper from a voice-to-text transcription tool into a full Jarvis-like voice assistant that works globally across all applications on your PC, including all IDEs and system functions. The desktop PC will serve as the main hub, with Genie Whisper able to both listen and talk back using text-to-speech. The solution will remain completely local and free, with no cloud dependencies.
