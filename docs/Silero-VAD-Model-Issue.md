# Silero VAD Model Download Issue

## Issue Description

As of March 29, 2025, we've encountered an issue with downloading the Silero Voice Activity Detection (VAD) model. The model is a critical component of our audio processing pipeline, used to detect speech segments in audio input.

### Symptoms

- The `download_models.py` script fails to download the Silero VAD model with a 404 error
- Attempts to download from alternative sources result in 401 Unauthorized errors
- The original repository URLs appear to have changed or access has been restricted

### Technical Details

The original download method used in `download_models.py` was:

```python
model, utils = torch.hub.load(
    repo_or_dir='snakers4/silero-vad',
    model='silero_vad',
    force_reload=False,
    onnx=False,
    verbose=False
)
```

We also attempted to download the ONNX model directly from:
```
https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/raw/master/files/silero_vad.onnx
```

Alternative sources we tried:
1. `https://huggingface.co/snakers4/silero-vad/resolve/main/silero_vad.onnx` (401 Unauthorized)
2. `https://huggingface.co/alphacep/vosk-models/resolve/main/vad/silero_vad.onnx` (401 Unauthorized)
3. `https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/raw/master/models/vad/silero_vad.onnx` (404 Not Found)

## Impact

- The VAD component may not function properly without the model
- This affects the accuracy of speech detection in the audio pipeline
- The application can still function using WebRTC VAD as a fallback, but with reduced accuracy

## Attempted Solutions

1. Created an alternative download script (`download_vad_model.py`) that tries multiple sources
2. Added proper headers to avoid 403 errors
3. Attempted to use Hugging Face Hub as an alternative source

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Short-term**: Use WebRTC VAD as the primary VAD method until the Silero VAD model issue is resolved
   - WebRTC VAD is already implemented and working
   - It's less accurate but sufficient for basic functionality

2. **Medium-term**: Bundle the Silero VAD model with the application
   - Once we obtain a working copy of the model, include it in the repository
   - This eliminates the need for downloading during setup
   - Requires careful consideration of licensing and file size

3. **Long-term**: Implement a more robust model download system
   - Create a centralized model repository for our application
   - Implement version checking and automatic updates
   - Add fallback mechanisms for all critical models

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the VAD implementation to prioritize WebRTC VAD when Silero is unavailable
2. Continue searching for alternative sources for the Silero VAD model
3. Once found, add the model to our repository or create a reliable download mechanism
4. Update documentation and setup scripts to reflect these changes

## Status

- **Current Status**: Investigating alternative sources
- **Priority**: Medium (WebRTC VAD provides a functional fallback)
